<!-- difference between tags and elements -> tags are just <html></html> but elements are everything in between including opening and closing tag.
Everything on the webpage is between html tags..head tag is not shown on page however it contains metadata about that page..body tag contains the things that will be shown on the webpage...h1 tag should be used once in the page -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <!--lang attribute for specifying language of the web page,aiding search engines and browsers in understanding and processing the content-->
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" /> <!--Character encoding is how characters (letters, numbers, symbols, etc.) are represented as bytes when sent from the server to the browser.When a browser loads an HTML document, it must know how to interpret the bytes of data it's receiving. If it uses the wrong encoding, characters might appear as gibberish or question marks (ï¿½).-->
    <meta name="author" content="Ankit Raj"> <!--this tells the browser that this metadata is specifying the author of the webpage-->
